    authors: ['Ankur Vasani', 'Rashmi Kamdar'],
    abstract: "The proposed paper introduces an innovative Intelligent Refrigerator System that leverages the power of Object Detection and Machine Learning to revolutionize home food management. The system's Object Detection capabilities enable the refrigerator to scan its contents, providing an accurate inventory of stored items. Utilizing machine learning algorithms, the system then suggests recipes based on the scanned items. Furthermore, it predicts the shelf life of products and alerts the user through a mobile app. Additionally, the system automates the creation of frequently used item lists, facilitating seamless online shopping. This integrated approach offers a smart, efficient, and user-friendly solution for organizing, planning, and optimizing household food management, promising to enhance convenience and reduce wastage.",

    title: 'Revolutionizing Traditional Supermarkets: A Comprehensive Solution for Enhancing Efficiency, Security and Customer Satisfaction',
    conference: "ACM's 2024 Sixteenth International Conference on Contemporary Computing (IC3)",
    date: 'July 1,2024',
    doi: '10.1145/3675888.3676096',
    link: "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1usWdm6UjTfG6RS4hcBq9zoaES03T__cL/view",
    authors: ['Ankur Vasani', 'Om Tanna', 'Krishna Thakkar', 'Malav Gotecha'],
    abstract: "This research proposes an Artificially Intelligent enabled Smart Supermarket System for enhanced efficiency, security and reduces man power as compared to traditional Supermarkets. In order to ensure a perfect omnichannel shopping experience the system uniquely includes an Artificially Intelligent model. Customers can scan items on the go with the app in their smartphones, select product variants as required, add the product to their virtual cart and pay online for the total cart value. With the help of YOLOv5 computer vision algorithm, eliminating long checkout queues and manpower the system proves to be revolutionizing the traditional supermarket procedures. Moreover, the system also incorporates the indoor navigation assistance on customerâ€™s app to facilitate easy access and navigation to preferred items. This futuristic solution not only provides valuable insights for business development but also is proven to be more efficient and helpful for customers saving their time and companies resources.",
